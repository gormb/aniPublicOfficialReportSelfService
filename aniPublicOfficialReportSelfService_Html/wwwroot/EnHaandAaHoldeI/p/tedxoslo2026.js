<hr>12:00-16:00<br>[detaljer c='Mats Kristensen: "What If We Measured Leaders by Trust, Not Targets?"']<hr>Mats Kristensen: "What If We Measured Leaders by Trust, Not Targets?"<br>This talk is a perfect opening. It is based on one of Norway's most central values – trust – and challenges it in a modern context. It is a direct, concrete link to "The Code of Trust" and our Nordic advantage, and shows how an invisible force can become a competitive advantage.<hr>[/detaljer]<br>[detaljer c='Stephanie Lurch: "Medicine Needs Medicine: Three questions that could change healthcare forever"']<hr>Stephanie Lurch: "Medicine Needs Medicine: Three questions that could change healthcare forever"<br>A powerful talk that illuminates power as an "invisible force" in healthcare. It forces us to look at values like equality and justice in one of our most important social institutions. By asking the three questions (Who gets what? Who does what? Who decides?), she makes invisible inequalities visible and connects it directly to the "Re:Human" framework.<hr>[/detaljer]<br>[detaljer c='Dr. Laura Penn: "Reigniting Craft in an Age of Code: A Revolution of the Heart"']<hr>Dr. Laura Penn: "Reigniting Craft in an Age of Code: A Revolution of the Heart"<br>This talk serves as a powerful counterweight to the dominance of technology. It places human 'craft' and the value of the imperfect and emotional at the center, challenging us to remember what is uniquely human. An essential 'purpose' entry that asks us what truly matters before we build the new world.<hr>[/detaljer]<br>
<hr>17:30-19:00<br>[detaljer c='Rémy Bigot: "The Invisible code: How AI shapes us before we even realize it"']<hr>Rémy Bigot: "The Invisible code: How AI shapes us before we even realize it"<br>The title and content are a perfect match. Rémy will provide concrete examples of how AI systems 'invisibly' control our choices and behavior, thereby uncovering one of the most powerful forces of our time. This is a talk that invites the audience to see behind the veil.<hr>[/detaljer]<br>[detaljer c='Dora Makszy: "Almost hired: the silent filters of belonging"']<hr>Dora Makszy: "Almost hired: the silent filters of belonging"<br>An incredibly powerful and personal story that makes the invisible barriers in the Norwegian workplace visible. The talk uncovers 'unconscious bias' and 'coded preferences' that close doors to diversity and talent. It shows how these invisible social forces have a direct, noticeable consequence in people's lives.<hr>[/detaljer]<br>[detaljer c='Elena Marquetti-Ali: "The Hidden Language of Belonging: How Micro-Exclusions Shape Our Reality"']<hr>Elena Marquetti-Ali: "The Hidden Language of Belonging: How Micro-Exclusions Shape Our Reality"<br>A unique talk that will use the audience to uncover invisible social rules in real-time. It provides a visceral and personal understanding of how we ourselves create and maintain systems of exclusion, making the topic immediately relevant and uncomfortable (in a good way).<hr>[/detaljer]<br>[detaljer c='Georgene Summers: "Confessions Of A Fearless Warrior"']<hr>Georgene Summers: "Confessions Of A Fearless Warrior"<br>In this layer, we can also explore the internal, invisible forces. Georgene's talk is about fear that is 'ingrained' in us, and how we often don't know where it comes from. It complements the technological and social aspects with a deep personal and psychological perspective.<hr>[/detaljer]<br>

`You are an engaging and knowledgeable chatbot for TEDxOslo 2026 – a locally organized TEDx conference that explores the invisible forces shaping our lives, choices, and future.

The conference will delve into four main themes, reflecting these hidden influences:
① Technology and Algorithms: How hidden systems affect our choices and what we can do to regain control.
② Intuition and Decision-Making: Balancing gut feeling and analysis in a data-rich world.
③ Creativity and Art in a Technology-Dominated World: How technology both challenges and enhances creativity.
④ Social Movements and Societal Changes: How quiet trends and activism can create lasting change.

TEDxOslo 2026 takes place on February 26, 2026, in Oslo. Through inspiring talks and experiences, participants will gain insight into how these invisible forces, like algorithms, social trends, and intuition, steer our lives.
